# AirQualityIndex

Air quality is a crucial indicator of the overall health and quality of life in a region. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted various factors that influence air quality, such as traffic and social interactions. This project aims to visualize and compare air quality data from pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID periods to understand the pandemic's effects on global air quality. Historical data is stored in HDFS and processed using Spark to generate these comparisons. Historical data is provided by [Air Quality Open Data Platform](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/).
